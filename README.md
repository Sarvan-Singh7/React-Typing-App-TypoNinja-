# 🚀 TypoNinja

TypoNinja is a typing practice website I built with my team because we were tired of old, boring typing tools.  
We wanted something modern, fast, clean, and actually helpful — so we created TypoNinja.

It’s simple to use, looks good, and gives you clear insights into how you're improving over time.

## 🌟 Why We Built TypoNinja
Most typing sites either look outdated or don’t give meaningful stats.  
We wanted a tool that:

- feels smooth and minimal  
- shows real-time performance  
- tracks your progress  
- saves your typing history  
- helps you actually get better  

So TypoNinja focuses on **speed, accuracy, consistency, and progress over time**, without distractions.
